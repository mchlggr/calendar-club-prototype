Here’s a compact strategy idea for your Ohio events project: treat it like a **local attention protocol**—a network where publishing an event is a signal of status and belonging, not admin work.

# How to make calendars feel like signaling (not chores)

**Core idea (plain English):**
When creators post events, they gain attention, reputation, and distribution automatically. The more people post, the more valuable posting becomes (network effects).

## Atomic incentives (small wins that stack)

* **Auto‑reach:** One upload → syndicated to Eventbrite, Luma, Meetup, IG bio link, email digest, SMS, and Slack channels you curate.
* **Social proof badge:** “Listed on Calendar Club” badge + verified organizer check (use on sites, flyers, and profiles).
* **Ranking juice:** Featured placement for organizers who (a) publish early, (b) include rich metadata, (c) confirm attendance data.
* **Instant assets:** Auto‑generated cover images, square posts, and a “week-of” teaser clip (plug‑and‑play for IG/LinkedIn).
* **Recap loops:** Post‑event AI recap page (photos + key quotes) the organizer can share; it backlinks to their profile.
* **Referral tokens:** Unique RSVP links give organizers trackable referrals → unlock perks (featured slots, newsletter mentions).
* **Host reputation:** A simple public score (on-time posts, show rate, feedback) that boosts discoverability.

## Product moves (keep it effortless)

* **Zero‑friction import:** Paste any URL → parse title/time/location/cover; suggest tags; prefill everything.
* **Bulk pipeline:** Google Calendar .ics + CSV + “reply-to-publish” email. No new tool learning.
* **Smart defaults:** Auto timezones/venues; “most common start time” memory per organizer.
* **Guardrails:** Soft validation (“Doors open ≠ start time?”) and conflict warnings across the metro.

## Distribution flywheel (Columbus-first)

* **Neighborhood feeds:** Shortlists per area (Short North, UA, Worthington) to seed density.
* **Affinity feeds:** Startup, design, AI, craft, family, jazz—let hosts opt into niches.
* **Weekly ritual:** “This Week in Ohio” email + SMS top 5 + widget partners (coworking spaces, libraries, bars).

## Data + status (make it feel like progress)

* **Host dashboard:** RSVPs by channel, first‑timers %, returner %, time‑to-RSVP, weather impact.
* **Community map:** Live density map of tonight’s events—organizers see how their event “lights up” the grid.
* **Year‑in‑review:** Personal Spotify‑Wrapped‑style for hosts (attendees reached, neighborhoods unlocked).

## Governance & trust

* **Clear norms:** No spam; must have venue + time; coherent tag use. Violations drop ranking.
* **Verified venues:** Venue owners can “claim” and co‑host; reduces fakes, improves data quality.

## Biz model (lightweight, aligned)

* **Freemium:** Free posting + basic distribution.
* **Pro Host ($/mo):** Featured slots, richer analytics, auto‑assets, SMS reminders, priority support.
* **Sponsor lanes:** Local brands sponsor specific feeds (e.g., “AI & Builder Week”).

## What to ship next (order of ops)

1. **Paste‑a‑URL publisher** with auto‑parse and two-click syndication.
2. **Weekly Columbus digest** (email + SMS) with one‑tap “Add to calendar.”
3. **Organizer profile + badge** (copy/paste HTML + PNG kit).
4. **Referral links + lightweight reputation** to seed the status loop.
5. **Neighborhood & niche feeds** to concentrate attention and reinforce the protocol vibe.

If you want, I can turn this into a one‑pager (value prop, screenshots/wireframes, and a 4‑week build plan) that your collaborators can react to.
