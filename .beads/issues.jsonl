Initial quick picks are static conversation starters (label vs. expanded value)\n2. Subsequent quick picks are LLM-generated per turn\n3. LLM decides when to search (ready_to_search flag)\n4. No static fallback - if LLM fails to generate picks, just don't show any\n\n## Phases\n1. Backend: AgentTurnResponse schema, update ClarifyingAgent, streaming events\n2. Frontend: Handle quick_picks events, update DiscoveryChat\n3. Cleanup: Deprecate ClarifyingQ, add tests\n\n## Files to Modify\n- api/models/conversation.py (new)\n- api/agents/clarifying.py (update output_type, instructions)\n- api/index.py (handle quick_picks, ready_to_search, fix event types)\n- frontend/src/lib/api.ts (QuickPickOption type)\n- frontend/src/components/discovery/DiscoveryChat.tsx (major refactor)\n- frontend/src/components/discovery/QuickPicks.tsx (label vs value)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- make check passes\n- First turn shows static quick picks\n- LLM responses include dynamic quick picks\n- ready_to_search=True triggers search\n- Full conversation flow works e2e","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-09T22:10:15.809799-05:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-09T22:28:43.871719-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T22:28:43.871719-05:00","close_reason":"Completed: Extended ChatStreamEvent types, refactored DiscoveryChat for LLM-driven quick picks, deprecated ClarifyingQ"}
